# Python for SQL Developers
This repo was developed to house "lesson" notebooks to assist in helping those familiar with SQL to use Python and the pandas library.

There is a supporting blog series that can be found [here](https://rebeccaebarnes.github.io/2019/08/25/python-sql-start).

## Contents
- [Python Basic Data Types](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/python-for-sql/blob/master/python_for_sql_basics.ipynb): strings, integers, floats, booleans
- [Python Basic Data Types II](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/python-for-sql/blob/master/python_for_sql_basics.ipynb): tuples, list, dictionaries
- [Python Control Flow](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/python-for-sql/blob/master/python_for_sql_flow.ipynb): if, for, while, range, zip, .format
