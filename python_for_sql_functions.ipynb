    "# Python for SQL: Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "What are functions? They are pre-built code that allows the execution of a particular task. There are actually many different functions that are used in SQL. These include things like math functions `AVG`, `FLOOR`, `MAX`, and string functions like `TRIM`, `LOWER`, `RIGHT`. (If you wanted to see a long list of SQL functions, you can check out [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_sqlserver.asp))\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has many built-in functions, but the true power of a programming language is that we can build our own functions. We'll use our knowledge of built-in functions to understand the elements of a function in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In this notebook I'll sometimes provide additional tips on a question that also provide the answer. Try not to scroll ahead if you want to maximize your learning!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of a Function\n",
    "Let's consider the SQL function [`AVG`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_count_avg_sum.asp). We'd write a query to find the average price something like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT AVG(price)\n",
    "FROM sales\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We could describe the components as:\n",
    "- Function name\n",
    "- Arguments/parameters\n",
    "- Function output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name of the Function\n",
    "Functions in SQL have specific names, and, if you spell it incorrectly, the function will not execute because the program doesn't understand the reference. We also typically identify functions because the name is accompanied by a set of brackets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python work the same way - they have a specific name and are defined with brackets. When naming functions in Python we typically use snake case, the same as variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments/Parameters\n",
    "Inside the brackets of `AVG` we find the `price` column. We would call `price` the argument or parameter for the function. Arguments can be required, variable in length, optional or not used. \n",
    "- **Required:** In the case of `AVG`, it is necessary to indicate which column is to be averaged. Otherwise, the function will have no idea what should be calculated. \n",
    "- **Variable:** In the case of [`COALESCE`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_coalesce.asp), while an argument is required, the number of columns that can be used in the function is variable.\n",
    "- **Optional:** For [`ROUND`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_round.asp) we have an example of an optional argument. The function will run without providing this information, based on a default functionality, but if we'd like more control on the operation, we can include the optional argument.\n",
    "- **Not used:** A function may be constructed so that we don't need an argument at all. In [`PI`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_pi.asp) no arguments are needed because the calculation does not need additional outside information to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, all of these principles work in Python functions! We'll explore these in detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Output\n",
    "In SQL, when we use a function, it is set up to have some kind of output or impact on the output. While this is also what we want to do in Python, when we start constructing them, we have to specify that this occurs. Without it, it's possible for a function to successfully execute without anything happening to the end result!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a Function\n",
    "Let's build a function in Python that operates in the same fashion as `AVG` in SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "What do we know about its functionality? How does it handle NULL values?"

    "### Development Steps\n",
    "When building functions a great strategy is to \n",
    "1. Write out in steps and words what the function should do\n",
    "2. Start with the simple/easy/obvious parts to make sure it's working and then add in the trickier parts\n",
    "3. Confirm your functionality outside of the function, then add details when you're confident it works\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already done the first part with our answer above, but now, let's break that down even further. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we're trying to find an average, typically what we do is:\n",
    "- Sum up all the values\n",
    "- Divide by the total number of values\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's start to build our function. As we've said before, in Python, a function has a name, followed by brackets. When defining a function, we need to put the term `def` in font, and the brackets are followed by a colon (`:`), and the next line is indented (exactly the same as we would use in our control functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "It would look something like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    do_something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We could call the above \"pseudo-code\" because what is written in the function isn't actual code (and will produce an error if you attempt to run it), but it gives an idea of what should be happening. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Documentation: enhancing usability\n",
    "When we build functions it is best practice to include the documentation for your function. This helps anyone who needs to use the function, or examine your code, understand what you did. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways that we can document.\n",
    "1. Docstrings\n",
    "2. Code comments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Docstrings\n",
    "Docstrings are included in the line right after defining your function. They are wrapped in three single or double quotation marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    '''Your docstring goes here.'''\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of your docstring should provide a brief explanation of what your function does. This should be written in active tense, e.g. \"Calculate the average of numbers in a list\". If this is sufficient for others to use your function easily, you can finish your docstring here. However, if you have a number of arguments with your function, or a complicated output, it is recommended to also include details of the inputs and outputs. The exact details of how you format these elements is somewhat up to you, but you should keep it consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical components for explaining your inputs and outputs are:\n",
    "- Type\n",
    "- How the variable is used\n",
    "\n",
    "This [article](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/docstrings-python#google-style) provides excellent examples of different docstring formats. I would recommend reviewing \"Google Style\" and \"Numpy Style\" sections to see some different versions and understand the pros and cons. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about Python best practices for docstrings, you can check out the [PEP Guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**16\\.** Redefine your function including a docstring. If you write out your function name and press Shift-Tab between the brackets, can you see your documentation?"

    "Documentation is another option to help people manage errors in using your functions. Python best practices do not require you to always manage errors resulting from incorrect types in your code. If it's correctly documented, then the user should understand why the error occurred, even without looking at the baseline code. However, there can be justifiable use cases why you might want to manage the error.\n",
    "\n",

    "    Calculate the average of the elements, ignoring NoneType values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        numbers (list-like): List of numeric values to average\n",

    "        average: Average value\n",
    "    '''\n",

If the user adds something else, it will produce an error, but this is essentially their responsibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, perhaps we know that the lists that the function will be receiving will contain elements that are not numerical and we still want it to calculate the average without raising an error. In this case, we would likely use a version of the function that can exclude a variety of types and our documentation would reflect this. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Comments\n",
    "As previously discussed, code comments are designated with the `#` symbol. These can be included above a line of code, or, at the end, for an \"in line\" comment. This [article](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/#why-documenting-your-code-is-so-important) provides an excellent discussion on the differences in the uses of docstrings and code comments, with some details on how and why to comment. (I'd recommend reading the first two sections especially)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a school of thought that if your code is well written enough, you should need minimal code comments. However, if you are new to writing code, code comments can help you navigate the sections of your code when you return to it, and also remind you want the code does. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the functionality of a piece of code, or the reason why it was done is something that would be very unclear to an unfamiliar reader, this is a time when code commments should definitely be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Argument Types\n",
    "Way back at the start of this notebook, we talked about different types of arguments within Python. We mentioned these:\n",
    "- **Required:** Must be included for the function to operate. \n",
    "- **Variable:** Required but can be a variable number of arguments.\n",
    "- **Optional:** The function will run without providing this information, based on a default functionality, but if we'd like more control on the operation, we can include the optional argument.\n",
    "- **Not used:** A function may be constructed so that we don't need an argument at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Required\n",
    "Required arguments is what we have used in our `my_average` function. Without this information, our code cannot run. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable\n",
    "As discussed, variable arguments are required, but perhaps we don't know the number of variables that will be used. We can designate these in python using `*args`. (The word \"args\" can be anything you wish, but this is the most common form)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_average(*numbers):\n",
    "    total_sum = 0\n",
    "    total_values = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    for number in numbers:\n",
    "        if number:\n",
    "            total_sum += number\n",
    "            total_values += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    average = total_sum/total_values\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return average\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks incredibly similar to what we had before, but it changes what is entered in the arguments, we would be expecting a series of elements entered directly into the brackets, rather than the list we were using previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_average(1, 3, 4, None, 8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once inside the function all of the variables we entered act as if they were inside a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional\n",
    "Optional arguments are those that are assigned a value within the function. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_average(my_collection, manage_type=True):\n",
    "    if manage_type:\n",
    "        my_collection = [x for x in my_collection if isinstance(x, numbers.Number)]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    total_sum = 0\n",
    "    total_values = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    for item in my_collection:\n",
    "        if item:\n",
    "            total_sum += item\n",
    "            total_values += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    average = total_sum/total_values\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return average\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function has a second argument that allows us to decide what we will do with elements in our collection that are not numbers. If `manage_type` is True, then we will remove them before we start calculating our average. However, if it is False, then only `None` elements would be removed in our code and any other types would cause an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "By assigning the argument a value, we can execute the function without including any information about this argument if we want to use the default functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "**17\\.** Run the cells below to observe the use of an optional argument. What happened with the second cell?"
